== Purpose

This Hello World extension sets a ClientLifecycleEventListener which logs the MQTT Version and identifier of every connecting and disconnecting client and registers a PublishInboundInterceptor to modify the payload of every Publish with the topic 'hello/world' to 'Hello World!'.

We strongly recommend to read the {hivemq-extension-docs}[HiveMQ Extension Documentation] to grasp the core concepts of HiveMQ extension development.

== Installation

. Clone this repository into a Java 11 Gradle project.
. Execute the Gradle task `hivemqExtensionZip` to build the extension.
. Move the file: `build/hivemq-extension/hivemq-hello-world-extension-4.39.0.zip` to the directory: `HIVEMQ_HOME/extensions`
. Unzip the file.
. Start HiveMQ.

== First Steps

=== Manual Testing

Connect with an {hivemq-mqtt-toolbox}[MQTT client] of your choice.
You should see a log message with its identifier and MQTT version.

=== Automatic Testing

Execute the `HelloWorldInterceptorIT` for automatic testing of the extension.
It uses the {hivemq-testcontainer}[HiveMQ Testcontainer] to automatically package, deploy and run the extension inside a HiveMQ docker container.
The test creates a {hivemq-mqtt-client}[HiveMQ MQTT Client] to publish and receive a message with the topic 'hello/world'.
It checks whether the payload has been changed correctly to 'Hello World!'.

== Next Steps

Awesome, you got your first HiveMQ 4 extension working.

Now read the {hivemq-extension-docs}[HiveMQ Extension Documentation] to see what extensions can do.
